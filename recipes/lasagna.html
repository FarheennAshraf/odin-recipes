            <strong>Eggs</strong>: 3 large eggs
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the meat</strong>: Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. 
            Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. 
            Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cook the noodles</strong>: While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Make the cheese layer</strong>: Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the lasagna</strong>: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. 
            Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. 
            Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bake the lasagna</strong>: 
            Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Serve</strong>:
            Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.
